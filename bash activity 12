Activity:

    Write a script which will copy the last entry/line in the passwd-like file specified by the $1 positional parameter
    Modify the copied line to change:
        User name to the value specified by $2 positional parameter
        Used id and group id to the value specified by $3 positional parameter
        Home directory to a directory matching the user name specified by $2 positional parameter under the /home directory
        The default shell to `/bin/bash'
    Append the modified line to the end of the file

Tip: awk provides the simplest method for completing this activity. Refer back to your notes on "09 - BASH Activity" if you are in need of starting point on this activity.

Note: The contents of the passwd-like file will be randomly generated on each submission. It is intended to read the last line once and store it in a variable.
