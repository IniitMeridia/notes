What is the absolute path for the binary cat man-page?
/usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz

Linux Basics 5

Search the man pages for the keyword digest. Then, use one of the binaries listed to hash the string OneWayBestWay using the largest sha hash available.

The resulting hash is the flag.
echo -n "OneWayBestWay" | sha512sum

Use File: /home/garviel/Encrypted

This file contains encrypted contents. Identify its file type, then decode its contents.

Hint: Use OpenSSL

Reminder: All challenges are done using the Terra box.
file Encrypted
unzip Encrypted
    extracting: cipher
    extracting: symmetric
openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -salt -in cipher -out decrypted -k AES128Key
cat decrypted
DeCrypt

Search the user home directories to find the file with the second-most lines in it. The flag is the number of lines in the file.

Hint: Exclude the VDI file!
find /home/*/ -type f ! -name '*vdi*' -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn

Linux Basics Users and Groups1

Read the file that contains the user database for the machine. Identify a strange comment.
cut -d: -f 5 /etc/passwd

Linux Basics Users and Groups2
10

Identify all members of the lodge group. List their names in alphabetical order with a comma in between each name.

Flag Format: name,name,name
grep 'lodge' /etc/group

Find the user with a unique login shell.
cut -d: -f 7 /etc/passwd | sort | uniq -u
grep '/bin/sh' /etc/passwd

Linux Basics Users and Groups4

Identify the algorithm, the amount of salted characters added, and the length of the hashed password in the file that stores passwords.

Hint: Research 'padding'...

Flag format: algorithm,#characters,#length
sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep garviel
--$6$ is SHA512 , $(random characters)$ is salt, everything after is hashed password
sha512,8,84

Find the directory named Bibliotheca. Enter the absolute path to the directory.
find /* -type d -name 'Bibliotecha' 2>/dev/null

Linux Basics Permissions2

Identify the number of users with valid login shells, who can list the contents of the Bibliotheca directory.
ls -l /media
(output)=  drwxr-xr-x 6 mephiston chapter 12288 Feb 28 2022 Blibliotheca ----- any user with a valid login shell can list the contents of the directory
grep -v "nologin\|flase" /etc/passwd ----- sync is not a user

Linux Basics Permissions3

The permissions that user sejanus has on /media/Bibliotheca, in octal format.

Flag format: #

Locate the file within /media/Bibliotheca that is modifiable by the only user that is part of the chapter group, but not part of the lodge group.

Hint: Not the hidden file...
grep "chapter\|lodge" /etc/group -to find members of the groups and find whos in chpater and not lodge
ls -lisa {directories inside of Bibliotheca}
Codex_Astartes

Linux Basics Permissions 5

Identify the file within /media/Bibliotheca where the owning group has more rights than the owning user.
ls -lisa {directories inside of Bibliotheca}
cd /media/Bibliotheca/Bibliotheca_quattuor
Codex_Hereticus

Linux Basics Permissions 6

Execute the file owned by the guardsmen group in /media/Bibliotheca, as the owning user.

The flag is the code name provided after a successful access attempt.

Hint: Remember your sudo options.
sudo -u gaunt /media/Bibliotheca/Bibliotheca_quattuor/./Tactica_Imperium
