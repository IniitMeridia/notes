What is the absolute path for the binary cat man-page?
/usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz

Linux Basics 5

Search the man pages for the keyword digest. Then, use one of the binaries listed to hash the string OneWayBestWay using the largest sha hash available.

The resulting hash is the flag.
echo -n "OneWayBestWay" | sha512sum

Use File: /home/garviel/Encrypted

This file contains encrypted contents. Identify its file type, then decode its contents.

Hint: Use OpenSSL

Reminder: All challenges are done using the Terra box.
file Encrypted
unzip Encrypted
    extracting: cipher
    extracting: symmetric
openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -salt -in cipher -out decrypted -k AES128Key
cat decrypted
DeCrypt

Search the user home directories to find the file with the second-most lines in it. The flag is the number of lines in the file.

Hint: Exclude the VDI file!
find /home/*/ -type f ! -name '*vdi*' -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn

Linux Basics Users and Groups1

Read the file that contains the user database for the machine. Identify a strange comment.
cut -d: -f 5 /etc/passwd

Linux Basics Users and Groups2
10

Identify all members of the lodge group. List their names in alphabetical order with a comma in between each name.

Flag Format: name,name,name
grep 'lodge' /etc/group

Linux Basics Users and Groups3

Find the user with a unique login shell.
cut -d: -f 7 /etc/passwd | sort | uniq -u
grep '/bin/sh' /etc/passwd

Linux Basics Users and Groups4

Identify the algorithm, the amount of salted characters added, and the length of the hashed password in the file that stores passwords.

Hint: Research 'padding'...

Flag format: algorithm,#characters,#length
sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep garviel
--$6$ is SHA512 , $(random characters)$ is salt, everything after is hashed password
sha512,8,84

Linux Basics Permissions1

Find the directory named Bibliotheca. Enter the absolute path to the directory.
find /* -type d -name 'Bibliotecha' 2>/dev/null

Linux Basics Permissions2

Identify the number of users with valid login shells, who can list the contents of the Bibliotheca directory.
