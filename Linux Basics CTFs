File: home/garviel/numbers

Use regular expressions to match patterns similar to valid and invalid IP addresses.

The answer is the count/number of lines that match in the file.

Linux Basics Regular Expressions3

File: home/garviel/numbers

Use regular expressions to match valid IP addresses. The flag is the number of addresses.

HINT: What are the valid numerical values of each octet in an IP address?

Linux Basics Regular Expressions4

File: home/garviel/numbers

Use regular expressions to match patterns that look similar to a MAC Address. Flag is a count of the number of matches.

HINT: This is a loose match! Some of these results won't be true MAC addresses.

Flag format: ####

Linux Basics Reformat1
