network analysis

tools
  sensors
    in-line
      test access point (TAP)
      MITM

    out of band (passive)
      switched port analyzer (SPAN)

in line
  IPS
  firewall
 impacts network latency

passive sensors
  monitors net segments
  can detect but cannot stop
  copies net traffic
    IDS
  no impact net latency

TAP
  device placed between 2 net devices
  packet collection with no loss
  not scalable

MITM
  attacker can sniff/manipulate traffic that flows through
  typically must be on same net
  capture dependent on attacker system and bandwidth

SPAN
  on switch
  packet collect from several switch ports at once
  can have high degree of packet loss 
  burdens network switch

Protocol specific identifiers
    HTTP: User-agent strings ,firefox,etc.
    SSH: Initial connection
    NetBIOS Name Service

ttl, frag, defulat ip header, window size, tcp options

Network Baseline Objective
    Determines the current state of your network
    Ascertain the current utilization of network resources
    Identify normal vs peak network traffic time frames
    Verify port/protocol usage

Perform Baselining
    Scope and Objectives:
        What traffic/protocols to capture?
        Which network segments?
        Which days?
        What times?

Anomaly Detection
    Indicator of Attack (IOA)
        Proactive
        A series of actions that are suspicious together
        Focus on Intent
        Looks for what must happen
            Code execution. persistence, lateral movement, etc.


    Indicator of Compromise (IOC)
        Reactive
        Forensic Evidence
        Provides Information that can change
            Malware, IP addresses, exploits, signatures

    .exe/executable files
    NOP sled
    Repeated Letters
    Well Known Signatures
    Mismatched Protocols ( ssh to telnet, protocol executing in unusual ways or utilizing other protocol defualts ) 
    Unusual traffic
    Large amounts of traffic/ unusual times
IOA   
    Destination IP/Ports
    Public Servers/DMZs
    Off-Hours
    Network Scans
    Alarm Events
    Malware Reinfection
    Remote logins
    High amounts of some protocols
IOC
    Unusual traffic outbound
    Anomalous user login or account use
    Size of responses for HTML
    High number of requests for the same files
    Using non-standard ports/ application-port mismatch
    Writing changes to the registry/system files
    Unexpected/unusual patching or tasks
