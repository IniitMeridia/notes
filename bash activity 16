Activity:

Design a script that detects the existence of directory: $HOME/.ssh

    Upon successful detection, copies any and all files from within the directory $HOME/.ssh to directory $HOME/SSH and produce no output. You will need to create $HOME/SSH.
    Upon un-successful detection, displays the error message "Run ssh-keygen" to the user.

NOTE: If the $HOME/.ssh directory does not exist, one may run the ssh-keygen command. Accept all defaults for the purposes of this exercise. This is not necessary for passing the activity but can be used for testing on your local machine.

===
#!/bin/bash
if [[ -d $HOME/.ssh ]]; then
    mkdir $HOME/SSH
    cp $HOME/.ssh/* $HOME/SSH/
else
    echo "Run ssh-keygen"
fi

different ways to copy the files
cp -a "$HOME/.ssh/." "$HOME/SSH"
cp -r $HOME/.ssh/. $HOME/SSH
find $dir -type f -exec cp "{}" $HOME/SSH
cp -rT $HOME/.ssh/ $HOME/SSH/
cp -R $HOME/.ssh/* $HOME/SSH
