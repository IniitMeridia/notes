-----Network Access----------
Layer 1- Physical - (PDU)Bit
cables, devices, radio waves
  binary, decimal, hexadecimal, base64
  32 bits = 
  base64 - very common encryption method, = sign is spaces
Layer 2 - Data Link - (PDU)Frame

Layer 3 - Network - (PDU)Packet
routing
Layer 4 - Transport - (PDU)Segment/Datagram
TCP / UDP
Layer 5 - Session - (PDU)Data

Layer 6 - Presentation - (PDU)Data

Layer 7 - Application - (PDU)Data


  Internet Standards Organizations
IETF - RFC's - why we created a protocol
IANA - Internet Numbers - manage ips and ports / responsible for MACOUI's
IEE - LAN/WAN electrical standards - responisble for setting and maintaining stuff like wifi,

base64 - very common encryption method, = sign is spaces, indicator of base64 encryption

Topologies


Devices
  Hubs - everyone get everything / dumb switch
  Repeaters - like a hub but amplifies the signal
  Switches - forward via frames 
  Routers - forward via IPs 

Ethernet Timing (Bit-Time)
10 Mbps - 100 ns
100 Mbps - 10 ns
1 Gbps - 1 ns
10 Gbps - .1 ns
100 Gbps - .01 ns

Layer 2 - 
data-link sublayers
  Mac(medium access control) - controls from layer 2 to layer 3 (top)
  LLC(logical link control) - controls from layer 3 to layer 2 (bottom)

Switch Operation
Building MAC-address (CAM) table
  learns by reading source mac addresses
Forwarding Frames
  decision based on Dest. Mac
Switching modes
  Cut-Through
  only checks destination MAC
  Fragment-Free
  looks at Ethernet Frame header to ensure it is >=64 bytes, if not it is a runt frame
  Store-and-Forward
  accept and analyze entire packet

!!CAM Table Overflow Attack
  Send frames with bogus source MAC address to switch
  cause switch to fill table with bogus adresses
  switch will not be able to learn new (valid) MAC addresses
  valid mac's send broadcast to try and reconnect and bad guy gets valid mac's

MAC oui - first 24 bits by IANA
    vendor assigned - last 24 bits by vendor
Windows:
Unix/Linux: 
Cisco: 1234.5678.1234

Unicast: one to one

Multicast:one to many

Broadcast:

MACs can now be altered with software

Ethernet Header

VLAN
logically seperate hardware 
  -
trunk link - sends all info from 1 switch to another switch

VLAN Types
Default - VLAN 1
Data - User traffic
Voice - VOIP traffic
Management - switch and router management
Native - Untagged switch and router traffic
802.1Q  - VLAN Tag - 8100
802.1AD - double tagging - 88A8 ... 8100

!!VLAN Hopping Attack
switch spoofing(DTP)
single tagging
double tagging(using native VLAN)

ARP
IP to MAC/MAC to IP
Types
  ARP(OP 1 AND OP 2)
  RARP(OP 3 AND OP 4)
  Proxy ARP(OP 2)
  -
  Gratuitous ARP(OP 2) - Says hey this is my MAC
  -!!broadcasts to everyone can be used maliciously
arp cache
all resolved mac to ip

--
reachable
stale

Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) with ARP
Poison Arp cache with:
  Gratuitous ARP
  Proxy Arp


VLAN Trunking protocol (VTP)
dynamically add/remove/modify VLANs
advertises on trunk links
Modes:
  server
  client
  Transparent
Vulnerability:
cause switch to dump all VLAN info

Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)
used to dynamically create trunk links
autonegotiate 
Cisco proprieatary

Vulnerability
On by Default
can send crafted messages to form a VLAN trunk link
  recommended:
  disable

CDP, FDP, LLDP
discovery protocols

Vulnerability
clear text
enabled by default

STP
root bridge 
setup to prevent looping when sending to root bridge (Broadcast Storm)

!!Spanning-Tree Attack
carfted BPDUs
used to perform a DoS or MitM


port security  
  shutdown(default)
  protect
  restrict - logs
Vulnerability
mac spoofing

Layer 2 Attack Mitigation
shutdown unused ports
enable port security
ip source guard
manually assign stp root
bpdu guard
dhcp snooping
802.1x
dynaimc arp inspection(DAI)
static CAM entries
static ARP entries
diable DTP negotiations
Manually assign Acces/Trunk ports

IPv4 Packet Header


IPv4 Scopes
public
privte(RFC 1918)
loopback
link-local(APIPA) self assigned if not able to be assigned
multicast

IPv4 fragmetation
breaking up packets from higher MTU to lower MTU netowrk
performed by routers
MF flag is on from 1st unti 2nd to last
offset is on from 2nd until the last
offset = (MTU - (IHL x4)) / 8

IPv6 fragmentation
does not support fragmentation within its header

Vulnerability
use fragmentation overlaps to avoid firewall detection
Example: Teardrop attack

DHCP - DORA process
