    Write a script that determines your default gateway ip address. Assign that address to a variable using command substitution.

    NOTE: Networking on the CTFd is limited for security reasons. ip route and route are emulated. Use either of those with no switches.

    Have your script determine the absolute path of the ping application. Assign the absolute path to a variable using command substitution.
    Have your script send six ping packets to your default gateway, utilizing the path discovered in the previous step, and assign the response to a variable using command substitution.
    Evaluate the response as being either successful or failure, and print an appropriate message to the screen.

Pseudo Example:

A=$(command_1)
B=$(command_2)
C=$($A command_3 $B)
if [[ "$" <condition> "$" ]]; then
   echo "successful";
else
   echo "failure";
fi 

=====
A=$(route | grep 'default.*[[:digit:]]' | awk '{print $2}')
B=$(which ping)
C=" 0% packet loss"
D=$($B -c 6 $A | grep -Eo "$C")
if [[ "$C" == "$D" ]]; then
    echo "successful"
else
    echo "failure"
fi
