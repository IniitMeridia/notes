Activity:

    Write a script which will find and hash the contents 3 levels deep from each of these directories: /bin /etc /var
    Your script should:
        Exclude named pipes. These can break your script.
        Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to separate files.
        Determine the count of files hashed in the file with hashes.
        Determine the count of unsuccessfully hashed directories.
        Have both counts output to the screen with an appropriate title for each count.

Example Output:

Successfully Hashed Files: 105
Unsuccessfully Hashed Directories: 23

====
#!/bin/bash
mkdir $HOME/HASHES
find /bin /etc /var -maxdepth 3 ! -type p -exec md5sum {} > $HOME/HASHES/succes 2>$HOME/HASHES/fail \;
A=$(wc -l $HOME/HASHES/success | awk '{print $1}')
B=$(grep -c "Is a directory" $HOME/HASHES/fail)
if [[ "$A" ]];
    then
        echo "Successflly Hashed Files: $A";
        echo "Unsuccessfully Hashed Drectories: $B";
    else
        echo "oops";-maxdepth 3
