Using ONLY the find command, find all files on the system with inode 4026532575 and print only the filename to the screen, not the absolute path to the file, separating each filename with a newline. Ensure unneeded output is not visible.

Tip: The above inode is specific to this CTFd question and might not be in use on your Linux Opstation. Instead, you can test your command on your Linux OpStation against inode 999.

=find -iname 4026532575 -printf "%f"
