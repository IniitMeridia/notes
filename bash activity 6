Write a basic bash script that greps ONLY the IP addresses in the text file provided (named StoryHiddenIPs in the current directory); sort them uniquely by number of times they appear.

It is not important to have a regular expression that only catches fully valid IP addresses. It is more important that you become familiar with creating and using regular expressions. Below, there are some useful websites that you can use to visually see what your regular expression pattern is matching on.

E.g., [1-4]{0,5}

Bracket Expression: [1-4] = 1 or 2 or 3 or 4

Repetitions: {0,5} = above numbers (1,2,3,4) appear from 0 to 5 times, meaning our number can be between 1 and 44444

Interpreted BASH Chars: . | $ ` \ ! must be escaped with \ in a regex. I.E. to match on a backslash, you must use \\ in your pattern.

Note: The basics of regular expressions are assumed knowledge for this module, and you will need to call back to prior learning. If you are in need of a quick refresher, the following man pages could be useful.

    man egrep
    man regex.7

=grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" StoryHiddenIPs | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
