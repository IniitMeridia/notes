Donovian Mapping & Reconnaissance (DMR)
XX OCT 2023
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: Scanning & Reconnaissance

Objective: In an effort to aid Gorgas Cyber forces, you have been tasked to assist with an overall collection and analysis of data from Donovian Cyberspace and their networks. You are tasked to perform various types of reconnaissance to accomplish this. The Gorgan Active Recon cell gained access to a boundary router and gathered the following intelligence belonging to deployed Donovian forces but have not been able to put together any mapping of their overall infrastructure. Aid the efforts by building a map of the entire network including networking devices and the target host machines below with:

Gathered Intelligence: Credentials
net1_student17:password17
vyos:password

The regional COCOM has provided direction to build a network map providing the following details, in order to drive future cyberspace operations:

    Device type

    Hostname

    Interface type

    Interface IP

    Subnet Mask CIDR

    Routing Protocol, IP network and Network Name groupings

    Open ports

    Operating system type and versions

Tools/Techniques: dig, nmap, nc, /dev/tcp

Vyos Commands: show interfaces

Scenario Credentials: Perform DNS recon on your ctfd server to obtain the start flag.

The start flag is an encoded string that is in a record associated with your CTFd server. Decode this string for the flag

Prior Approvals: You will use SSH to progress through the network but all scanning should be conducted from your INTERNET_HOST
