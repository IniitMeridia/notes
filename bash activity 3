Activity:

Using ONLY the find command, find all empty files/directories in directory /var and print out ONLY the filename (not absolute path), and the inode number, separated by newlines.

Tip: When using the man pages, it is better to focus your search then to visually scan 1000+ lines of text. Combining the output with the grep command, possibly with its -A, -B, or -C options, can help drive context driven searches of those manual pages.

Example Output

123 file1
456 file2
789 file3

=find /var -empty -printf "%i %f\n"
