Access can be gained through any combination or wired, optical or wireless means. 
While some acesses can be achieved remotely through assigned permissions and other means, legitiamte or fraudlent access to closed
networks and other systems that are virtually isolated may require physical proximity or more complex, time consuming processes.

INTRODUCTION TO JOINT OPERATIONS


military was incapable of coordinating land, sea, and air activities across its two military departments (War and Navy)

in 1942, Pres. F.D. Roosevelt created the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)

during and after WWII, numerous efforts sought to rectify the U.S. military's disjointedness.
  the national secuirty act of 1947
    created NME

  legislated revisions to the national security act in 1949, 1953, and 1958 attempted to mend these deficiencies, particularly
    strengthened SECDEF

  military departments retained a DE FACTO role in the operational chain of command and never complied with the provision of strengthening the unified commanders

numerous military failures highlighted instituional deficienies at all levels. the adhoc nature of the 
 joint effort in these operations contributed to an inability to effectively link tactical actions to strategic ends.

in addition to the impetus provided by these operational failures, several disparate factors came together in the mid-1980s, which
enabled DOD organizational change. these included extensive congressional hearings, a major Senate in quiry, bi-partisan openness to rectify
the situation, a presidential commision, and the appointment of a reform-minded CJCS, admiraal William Crowe, in october 1985.

Major changes:
  chain of command & military advice
  interaction of the services
  personnel mannagement
  shared procurement


supported comander - has the the authority to exercise general direction of supporting effort  says how they are doing that

supporting commander - determines forces, tactics, methods, procedures, and communications for employment (includes internal task organization)  says what he wants done

Gloal Force Management (GFM) is a group of related processes the establishes strategic C2 and strategic posture and provide
insight to global military force availability based on military plans and operations to support DODs strategic decisions.
GFM integrates readiness, assignment, allocation, appoirtionment, and assessment processes for force management and planning constructs.

physical aspects are the material characteristics, both natural and manufactured, of the environment that may inhibit or enhance communication. physical aspects may create
 constraints and 

human aspects are the interactions among and between people and the environment that shape human
behavior and decision making. those interactions are baseed upon the linguistic, social, cultural, psychological, and physical elements.

informational power


the elevation of information as a joint function impacts all operations and signals a fundamental
appreciation for the military role of information at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels within today's complex OE.

assessment of information in joint operations are condcted in accordance with the Operation Assessment Process

information forces, the building blocks of OIE units, are those Active Component and Reserve Component forces 
specifically organized, trained, and equiipped to create and/or support the creation of effects on the IE

effective integration of the appropriate u.s. government organizations will enhance the overall success of joint forcce 
operators. there are a multitude of organizations inside and outside DOD that are relevant to the joint forces management and application of information
