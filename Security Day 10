suid/sgid

suid bit:
find / -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null

sgid bit
find / -type f -perm /2000 -ls 2>/dev/null

BOTH suid and sgid
find / -type f -perm /6000 -ls 2>/dev/null

  crontab.guru

world writable files/folders
  /tmp
  /var/tmp

  find world writable directories
  find / -type d -perm /2 -ls 2>/dev/null

  find directories that current user is able to write to
  find / -type f -writable -o -type d -writable -ls 2>/dev/null


dot "." in PATH
  system uses PATH variable to locate commands, if ".:/home/stu..." then if a command is located in present directory, it will be the one that is run instead of the intended or anticpated command 

  echo $PATH to see if there is a dot "." in the PATH variable
  changing into a different directory will solve this issue
